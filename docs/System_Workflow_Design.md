# Emergency Ambulance System - Workflow Design

## System Overview
The Emergency Ambulance System is a web-based dispatch platform that manages emergency calls from initial request through completion. The system supports three primary user types with distinct interfaces and responsibilities.

## User Types & Roles

### 1. **Callers** (Public Users)
- **Access**: Public landing page
- **Purpose**: Request emergency medical assistance
- **Authentication**: None required

### 2. **Dispatchers** (Internal Staff)
- **Access**: Authenticated dashboard
- **Purpose**: Manage emergency calls, dispatch resources, monitor operations
- **Authentication**: Required (dispatcher role)

### 3. **Paramedics** (Field Staff)
- **Access**: Mobile-optimized field interface
- **Purpose**: Update call status, communicate with dispatch
- **Authentication**: Required (paramedic role)

## Complete System Workflow

### Phase 1: Emergency Call Initiation

#### Caller Workflow
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Caller visits landing page] --> B[Fills emergency form]
    B --> C[Selects emergency type]
    C --> D[Provides location - auto-detect or manual]
    D --> E[Enters contact information]
    E --> F[Describes patient condition]
    F --> G[Submits emergency request]
    G --> H[Receives confirmation with Call ID]
    H --> I[System creates EmergencyCall record]
    I --> J[Status: RECEIVED]
```

**Key Actions:**
- Emergency type selection (Cardiac, Trauma, Stroke, etc.)
- Location capture (GPS auto-detect or manual entry)
- Patient information collection
- Detailed incident description

**System Response:**
- Generates unique Call ID
- Creates EmergencyCall record with status "RECEIVED"
- Sends real-time notification to dispatchers

### Phase 2: Dispatch Operations

#### Dispatcher Dashboard Workflow
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Dispatcher logs in] --> B[Views real-time dashboard]
    B --> C[Monitors call queue - Pending tab]
    C --> D[Reviews emergency details]
    D --> E[Checks available ambulances on map]
    E --> F[Drag-drop dispatch action]
    F --> G[Selects ambulance unit]
    G --> H[Assigns paramedic if available]
    H --> I[Confirms dispatch]
    I --> J[Updates call status to DISPATCHED]
    J --> K[Updates ambulance status to EN_ROUTE]
    K --> L[Real-time map updates]
```

**Dashboard Components:**
- **Left Panel**: Call Queue (Pending/Active/Transporting tabs)
- **Center Panel**: Interactive map with emergency markers and ambulance locations
- **Right Panel**: Resource status (hospitals, fleet overview)

**Key Actions:**
- View pending emergency calls
- Drag ambulance to emergency location for dispatch
- Monitor real-time status updates
- Manage fleet resources

---

### Phase 3: Field Operations

#### Paramedic Field Workflow
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Paramedic logs in] --> B[Views assigned call]
    B --> C[Updates status: EN_ROUTE]
    C --> D[Travels to emergency location]
    D --> E[Updates status: ON_SCENE]
    E --> F[Assesses patient condition]
    F --> G[Updates status: TRANSPORTING]
    G --> H[Transports to hospital]
    H --> I[Updates status: AT_HOSPITAL]
    I --> J[Updates status: CLOSED]
    J --> K[Returns to available status]
```

**Field Interface Features:**
- Large, mobile-optimized buttons for status updates
- Current call information display
- One-tap status transitions
- Real-time location updates (optional)

## Status Flow Diagram

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> RECEIVED: Caller submits request
    RECEIVED --> DISPATCHED: Dispatcher assigns ambulance
    DISPATCHED --> EN_ROUTE: Paramedic confirms dispatch
    EN_ROUTE --> ON_SCENE: Paramedic arrives at location
    ON_SCENE --> TRANSPORTING: Patient loaded, en route to hospital
    TRANSPORTING --> AT_HOSPITAL: Arrived at hospital
    AT_HOSPITAL --> CLOSED: Call completed
    CLOSED --> [*]
    
    note right of RECEIVED: Caller creates emergency request
    note right of DISPATCHED: Dispatcher assigns resources
    note right of EN_ROUTE: Paramedic en route to scene
    note right of ON_SCENE: Paramedic on scene treating patient
    note right of TRANSPORTING: Patient being transported
    note right of AT_HOSPITAL: Patient delivered to hospital
    note right of CLOSED: Call completed, ambulance available
```

## Real-Time Communication Flow

### WebSocket Events
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Caller
    participant S as System
    participant D as Dispatcher
    participant P as Paramedic
    
    C->>S: Submit emergency request
    S->>D: NEW_EMERGENCY event
    D->>S: Dispatch ambulance
    S->>P: UNIT_DISPATCHED event
    S->>D: Ambulance status update
    P->>S: Status update (EN_ROUTE)
    S->>D: STATUS_UPDATE event
    P->>S: Status update (ON_SCENE)
    S->>D: STATUS_UPDATE event
    P->>S: Status update (TRANSPORTING)
    S->>D: STATUS_UPDATE event
    P->>S: Status update (AT_HOSPITAL)
    S->>D: STATUS_UPDATE event
    P->>S: Status update (CLOSED)
    S->>D: Call completed notification
```
